The hierarhical design s27.dual.sv contains 3 modules:
s27                      : logicbox instantiated      0 times  pi =    5 po =    5 nd =       12 lat =      0 box =      4
buf0                     : undefbox instantiated      1 times  pi =    0 po =    0 nd =        0 lat =      0 box =      0
dffx1                    : undefbox instantiated      3 times  pi =    0 po =    0 nd =        0 lat =      0 box =      0
The outputs of all box instances are connected.
