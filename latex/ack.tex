I would like to thank my research adviser Professor Martin D. F. Wong, for his ideas, constant guidance and discussions about my thesis project. I would also like to acknowledge Muhammet Mustafa Ozdal for his previous work on single-layer bus routing, which was the foundation of this project. Finally, I would like to thank my parents for funding my study at the University of Illinois. This thesis would not be possible without their support.
